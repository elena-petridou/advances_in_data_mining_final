# LSH for Discovery of most similar users (Netflix prize)

Implementation of the Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) algorithm for discovering most similar pairs of users (Netflix prize)

This project was completed by Eleonora Roncaglia, Bashier Gulzar and Elena Petridou as part of the course Advances in Data Mining offered by Leiden University.

The aim of the assignment was to implement Locality-Sensitive Hashing with the aim of discovering pairs of most similar users, based on their ratings of movies. The dataset was a condensed version of the original Netflix Prize dataset. 

Our solution found a reasonable amount of similar users (183) within 60 seconds on a Macbook Air M1 with 8GB RAM. 

More details on our implementation as well as a full analysis of the hyperparameters tuned and how they affect performance can be found in the PDF file.
